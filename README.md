# Opvia React Clicker Exercise

Youâ€™ve come up with a cool idea for an app. Itâ€™s a clicker with two buttons. One to increase the number and one to decrease the number. Youâ€™re going to make this available on the web and see what happens! You just know itâ€™s going to blow up. Itâ€™s a big project, so youâ€™re making a front-end only MVP first. Unfortunately your pet iguana died yesterday and you couldnâ€™t think straight. You wrote some code that works but you arenâ€™t proud of.
Today is a new day. Refactor this react component and make your clicker look cool!

```jsx
import React from "react";
 
class Clickme extends React.Component {
 constructor(props) {
   super(props);
   this.reduce = this.reduce.bind(this);
   this.state = { count: 0 };
 }
 reduce() {
   this.state.count = this.state.count + -1;
   this.forceUpdate();
 }
 render() {
   return (
     <div style={{ backgroundColor: "white" }}>
       <div>Clicker Count {this.state.count}</div>
       <br />
       <button
         onClick={() => {
           this.state.count = this.state.count + 1;
           this.forceUpdate();
         }}
       >
         Add one
       </button>{" "}
       <button onClick={this.reduce}>Reduce by one</button>
     </div>
   );
 }
}
export default Clickme;
```

# What I did
- Created the component

## General feedback
- ðŸ‘Ž Too easy (unless I missed something?)
- ðŸ‘Ž Too unstructured - what did you want to see out of this? 
    - That the candidate can refactor a class component?
    - Does the codebase even _have_ any class components to refactor?
    - That they understand hooks?
- Might be nice to have something with a test already in place, and have to create a new component to pass the spec?
